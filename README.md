## About

RESTful API that imitates a parking lot system.

Written with ❤️ using TypeScript, Node.js & Express, MySQL & Prisma. <br/>
Swagger is used for generating the documentation.

## Documentation

Make sure to visit the [API's endpoints documentation](https://nathan1us.github.io/Lab08-Parking/) to find out more information about how each endpoint functions. It can be found by clicking [here](https://nathan1us.github.io/Lab08-Parking/).

## Requirements

[![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
[![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## How to run

1. Clone the repository

2. Configure your MySQL connection using a `.env` file. It must follow the same structure as the `.env.example` file, provided with the project during cloning.

2. Run `npm install` from a CLI of your choice.

* (Optional) Run `npm run test` to perform unit testing.
3. Run `npm start dev` from a CLI of your choice to start the API.

4. Use Postman or a similiar app/method to access the API's endpoints. (Note: Inside the project's root folder you can find a Postman collection file which is ready for importing into Postman. It contains pre-defined request templates to make accessing the API faster and easier.)
